# New-Moodify
**What the project is:**
This project is a simple website called Moodify. It lets users pick their mood (Happy, Sad, Energetic, or Relaxed) and then gives them a music recommendation to match their mood. The site is built using HTML, Bootstrap for styling, and a little JavaScript for interactive behavior.

**Why it is useful**
Moodify is useful because:

It makes it easy and fun for anyone to discover music that suits how they feel.

With just one click, users get a quick music suggestion based on their current moodâ€”no searching or browsing needed.

The design is simple, responsive, and easy for anyone to use.

**How to install, run, or use it**

Open index.html in any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.). There is no need to install anything else.
